This is a test for markdown writing.

It may not works well.

inline math expression is this $y=f(x)$.

block math expression is following one.

$$
f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{x^i}{i!}
$$

```python
# This is a python code block

import numpy as np

A = np.random.rand((10, 10))
y = np.random.rand((10, 1))
x = A.inv.dot(y)
```

```matlab
% This is a matlab code block

A = randn(10, 10)
y = randn(10, 1)
x = A\y
```

```cpp
// This is a cpp code block

#include <stdio>

void main(void)
{
    exit(0);
}
```
